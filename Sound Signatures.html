	<h3>
		More specifically about different sound signatures
	</h3>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>
		Every headphone or In-Ear Monitor (IEM) have their own unique sound signatures. There are about <u><b>6 <i>different</i> sound signatures:</u></b> 
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Flat</li>
		<li>Bright</li>
		<li>Balanced</li>
		<li>V-Shaped</li>
		<li>Extra Bass</li>
		<li>Warm</li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Flat</li>
		
		<p>
			A flat sound signature is very popular in the audiophile community because it keeps all frequencies equal. If all frequencies are equal then the audio
			will sound as natural as possible.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<li>Bright</li>
		
		<p>
			This sound signature has a boosted treble and midrange. It exposes some imperfections in good recordings and that's what makes them a bit popular
			among the audiophile community. However, some listeners may experience listening fatigue. Listening fatigue is when someone becomes tired or just can't listen anymore
			and must take a break before continuing to listen to music. Headphones that sound too bright may also end up seeming harsh and unpleasent
			to listen to.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<li>Balanced</li>
		
		<p>
			Balanced is basically the same as flat except some minor tweaks make it more fun. Most manufacturers try to achieve this by balancing all the frequencies from
			low to highs. Nothing is left out or stands out. This enables the listener to hear the entire range of elements in a song - from vocals, guitars,
			to bass drums. The result is a balanced and lively sound.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<li>V-Shaped</li>
		
		<p>
			V-Shaped sound signatures have a emphasized bass and treble frequencies. Rock songs get that live 'in-your-face' feel with amazing guitar solos, soaring vocals,
			and grooving drums. The V curve denotes enhanced bass and treble frequencies with a reduced mid-range. This makes the audio sound crisp and loud.
			It is quite popular with most listeners. A good pair of IEMs for pretty cheap are the BLON BLO3, I have them and listen to them everytime I can and they sound amazing.
			The audio is very clear and crisp, and with a pair of Comply T-500 eartips, everything is just super nice. Some good pair of headphones however are the HD560S, they also
			sound great but if you can, you should get the HD6XX from MassDrop.
		</P>
		
		<br>
		
		<li>Extra Bass</li>
		
		<p>
			This doesn't really need an explaination. For Bassheads, you would go for these types of headphones and some suggestions are the Meze 99 series or Hifiman Sundara.
			Both of those cans are very good and have lots of bass, but it might be a bit much for some.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<li>Warm</li>
		
		<p>
			You can kind of tell what kind of sound signature this will be just from the name but probably won't be able to pin down exactly what it is.
			A warm sound signature is when the bass is slightly emphasized and the high treble is rolled off to remove the harshness of the audio.
			What you get is a warm, smooth sound. Think of it as a warm cocoon envoloping you with a variety of softness - like a comforter made of audio.
			Instruments like cello and saxophone can be enjoyed much more.

	<p>
		This is extremely useful for determining quality of audio devices and can give us a peak into how exactly its reproducing the sound.
		You can also use this for equalizing your headphones to your liking.

	<h3>
		Here is a small table I made that shows some audio headphones and IEMs that I like and dislike.
	</h3>
	
	<p>
		Remember that this is completely subjective. If you like how the audio sounds on one device then don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.
		Although there are some standards like how clear the audio is, it doesn't really matter as long as you like them. It's only used as a sort of benchmark
		to tell how "good" a device is. Obviously most people wouldn't want to listen to music if it sounds very unclear to the point where it sounds like static.
		Just don't drink snake oil.
